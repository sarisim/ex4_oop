We choose to implemtent the Trees package in sevral classes:
Flora - the main class that generates the trees at random locations.
Trunk- the class that represents the trunk of a tree, with properties like height and diameter.
Leaf - the class that represents the leaves of a tree, with properties like color and size and the moving in the
wind logic.
Fruit - the class that represents the fruit of a tree, with properties like type and the reappearance after eaten
 feature.
Tree - the class that represents a single tree, contains a trunk and lists of the fruits and leaves.

The Flora class is responsible for generating a forest of trees, each with its own trunk, leaves, and fruits at
random locations. The trees are generated with random properties for their trunks, leaves, and fruits.
the Flora class uses a callback function to decide at which height to generate the trees.
The Game manger calls the FLora class Create method to generate the trees and then he adds them to the game world
object by object.
